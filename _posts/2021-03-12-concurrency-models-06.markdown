### Software Transaction Memory
- Software transactional memory (STM) is a technique for simplifying concurrent programming by allowing multiple state-changing operations to be grouped together and performed as a single atomic operation.
- A concurrency control mechanism analogous to database transactions for controlling access to shared memory in concurrent computing.(**Compare & Swap instead of locks**) It is an alternative to lock-based synchronization.
- STM provides applications programmers with an alternative to mutual-exclusion locks which avoids many of the latterâ€™s pitfalls, including risk of deadlock, unnecessary serialization, and priority inversion

#### Example Datastructures
- Structures in Clojure & Haskell
